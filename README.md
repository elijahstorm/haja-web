Haja (하자) means "Let's do it together" in Korean. During my time in Korea, I was really impacted by how beautiful their systems are. From the language, to architecture, to media and tech design. There is so much uniquness that can be felt in the designs of South Korea. It can best be described as Elegant Simplicity. I wanted to try and capture that sense of grandeur in simplicity. Under the hood, making a product that feels simple and elegant might require a lot of complexities and a lot of necessary abstractions.
